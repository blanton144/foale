To set up on Utah:

* Set $FOALE_DIR as an environmental variableto the root directory of this product
* Add $FOALE_DIR/python to the python path (environmental variable $PYTHONPATH
* Add $FOALE_DIR/bin to your system path (environmental variable $PATH)
* Set $MNSA_DATA as an environmental variable:
  /uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/sdss50/sdsswork/sandbox/mnsa

There is example software here about how to read in the data.

For example, at this point you should be able to run the 
following on the Unix command line:

  "show_summary" - which will bring up a plot of the colors and 
                   absolute magnitudes of the galaxies; this 
                   just demonstrates how to read the summary
                   file we will use

  "show_example" - this shows how to read the data for a data
                   cube and set of maps

These scripts live in $MNSA_DIR/bin, and you should use them as
examples.

The data that is read by default is a re-reduction of the MaNGA DR17
data. The cubes have been made in a slightly different manner than 
for the official results, which yields higher resolution and a simpler
covariance matrix between pixels.

Unfortunately, that means we can't easily use the very nice system 
called "Marvin" for reading the data in python. But that's not going
to hurt us too much.
